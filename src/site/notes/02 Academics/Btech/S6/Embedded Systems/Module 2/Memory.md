### Memory
Modern microprocessor units (MMUs) perform address translations that provide a larger virtual memory space in a small physical memory.

### Caches
Microprocessor clock rates are increasing at a faster rate than memory speeds, such that memories are falling further and further behind microprocessors every day.As a result,computer architects resort to caches to increase the average performance of the memory system.==A cache is a small,fast memory that holds copies of some of the contents of main memory. Because the cache is fast, it provides higher-speed access for the CPU==

- Caches are widely used to speed up memory system performance
- accesses in the cache will be fast, while access to locations not cached will be slow
 >[!Note] Working Set 
 >Caching makes sense when the CPU is using only a relatively small set of memory locations at any one time; the set of active locations is often called the **working set**.

####  Hit or Miss
A cache controller mediates between the CPU and the memory system comprised of the main memory. The cache controller sends a memory request to the cache and main memory. 
1. *If the requested location is in the cache, the cache controller forwards the location’s contents to the CPU and aborts the main memory request; this condition is known as a ==cache hit==*.
2. *If the location is not in the cache, the controller waits for the value from main memory and forwards it to the CPU; this situation is known as a ==cache miss==*.

#### Caches
*A cache is a small,fast memory that holds copies of some of the contents of main memory. Because the cache is fast, it provides higher-speed access for the CPU; but since it is small, not all requests can be satisfied by the cache, forcing the system to wait for the slower main memory*

- [[L3\|L3]]
- *The set of active locations is often called the working set*
#advantages
-  The cache speeds up average memory access time
-  increases the variability of memory access times
